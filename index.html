    <p id="two">The show is about a young man named Giorno Giovanna with the ability to turn inanimate objects into animate objects like animals, plants, or even cells like skin/bone/blood/etc. The story follows his goal of taking down the drug-peddling mafia in Italy, all by becoming a member himself and working with a small group to take out the boss. He eventually befriends the group he joins and they start out on their secret mission to find out who the boss is and take him out, meanwhile fighting other people with bizarre powers and personalities.</p>
